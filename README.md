# CS4440-Data-Science

Data science is an interdisciplinary and emerging field where techniques from several areas are used to solve problems using data. This course provides an overview and hands-on training in data science, where students will learn to combine tools and techniques from computer science, statistics, data visualization, and the social sciences. The course will focus on 1) the process of moving from data collection to product, 2) tools for preparing, manipulating, and analyzing data sets (big and small), 3) statistical modeling and machine learning, and 4) real-world challenges.



Assignment details and instructions are in the PDF files. 
Since my dataset is fairly big for GitHub I decided to zip the files with the python code and upload them.
